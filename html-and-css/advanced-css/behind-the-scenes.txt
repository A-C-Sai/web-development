LOAD HTML ---> PARSE HTML (decode the code line-by-line) -------> Document Obj Model (DOM) (Where decoded HTML is Stored)
                    |
                    | As the browser parses the HTML it also finds the stylesheets
                    | included in the HTML header and starts loading them as well.

        Cascade & Specificity
#####################################

-  CSS RULE = Selector + Declaration Block
                                |
                                |----- Declarations

                                            |---- Property
                                            |---- Declared Value


- CASCADE : Process of combining different stylesheets and resolving conflicts b/w diff CSS rules and declarations,
when more than one rule applies to a certain element.

- Different sources of CSS: Author, User, Browser (User Agent)

- Importance > Specificity > Source Order

- Importance:
    - User !important declarations
    - Author !important declarations
    - Author declarations
    - User declarations
    - Default Browser declarations

- Specificity (inline, IDs, Classes, Elements) (left-to-right):
    - inline
    - IDs
    - Classes, Pesudo-Classes, Attribute
    - Elements, Pesudo-Elements

- Source Order: The last declaration in the code will override all other declarations and will be applied.

- * selector has a specificity of (0,0,0,0)

-  no combinators affect specificity.  The weight applied to a css declaration block is determined by the the number of each selector type in the matching selector.

- Rely more on specificity than order of selectors

- when using 3-rd party stylessheets, always put author stylesheets last in HTML head, allows us to override styles
