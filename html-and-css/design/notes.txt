Good Design:
-> immediate and lasting good impression of brand/ product
-> trust with brand
-> increased user's perceived value of brand/ product
-> gives users exactly what they were looking for

Typography:
-> ToolBox: google fonts, font squirrel, https://typescale.com/
-> making text beautiful and easy to read 
-> serifs: traditional/ classic look and feel, trustworthiness, good for long text
-> sans-serif: modern look and feel, clean and simple
-> reading experience: the smaller or longer the text, the larger the line height needs to be
-> establishing hirearchy

Colors:
-> ToolBox: Open Color, tailwindcss, flat ui colors 2, tint & shade generator, palleton, coolors
-> choosing a main color that matches website's personality, use a good color tone
-> main color and grey color (doesn't need to be grey, can be a very dark version of another color)
-> accent color
-> contrast ratio needs to be atleast 4.5:1 for normal test and 3:1 for large text (18px+)

Images & Illustrations;
-> ToolBox: Unsplash, Pexels, DrawKit, unDraw, squoosh
-> To account for high-res screens, make image dimensions 2x as big as their displayed size
-> Scale factor: Actual pixels the screen contains/ Pixels represented on screen
-> On high-res screens, scale factor is 2x or even 3x, on "normal" screens it's just 1x (1 physical pixel = 1 design pixel)

Icons:
-> ToolBox: Phosphor icons, ionicons, icons8, heroicons
-> visual accistance to text
-> product feature blocks
-> associated with actions and label them unless no space or icon is 100% clear
-> as bullet points

Shadows:
-> creates depth, the more shadow, the further away from the interface the element is 
-> can be used on boxes and text
-> shadows don't have to be black (glows)
-> can create illusions e.g. push down button, hovering

Border-Radius:
-> serious/elegant -----> playful/fun


Whitespace and Visual Hierarchy:
-> the right amount of whitespace makes designs look clean, modern and polished
-> whitespace communicates how different pieces of information are related to one another
-> whitespace implies invisible relationship b/w the elements of a loyout
-> The law of proximity
-> too much whitespace looks detached, too little looks too crammed
-> visual hierarchy is about establishing which elements of a design are the most important ones.
->       ""         is about drawing attention to these most important elements
->       ""         is about defining a "path" for users, to guide them through the page
->       ""         combination of position, size, colors, spacing, borders and shadows to establish a meaningful hierarchy b/w elements
-> we can also de-emphasize less important text, like labels or secondary/additional info
-> try emphasizing some component A over component B by de-emphasizing component B.


User Experience:
-> UI (looks and feels like), UX (how it works)
-> both of these are interlinked
-> A website or applications exists for a reason: a user has a goal for visiting it, and a business has a goal for creating it
-> Good UX design aligns the user's goals with the business' goals
-> law of locality


Inspiration:
-> land-book
-> one page love
-> awwwards
-> screenlane
