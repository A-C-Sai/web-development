Typography:

-> making text beautiful and easy to read 
-> serifs: traditional/ classic look and feel, trustworthiness, good for long text
-> sans-serif: modern look and feel, clean and simple
-> reading experience: the smaller or longer the text, the larger the line height needs to be
-> establishing hirearchy
